# E-Commerce Recommendation Engine: Leveraging SQL for Personalized Shopping Experiences
# Problem Statement:
An e-commerce platform aims to enhance its user experience by optimizing product
recommendations based on user interactions and past purchase history. The goal is to identify
patterns in user behavior, such as popular products, frequently interacted categories, and
purchasing habits, to provide personalized recommendations and improve customer engagement.
# Solution Overview:
# 1. Data Modeling and Database Design:
 - Designed and created tables to store user interactions, product details, and past purchases.
 - Defined appropriate data types, primary keys, and foreign key constraints to ensure data
integrity.
 - Normalized the database schema to minimize redundancy and optimize query performance.
# 2. Data Analysis and Exploration:
 - Utilized SQL queries to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the database tables.
 - Analyzed user interactions by counting views, clicks, and purchases for each product.
 - Identified popular products, frequently interacted categories, and user preferences through SQL
aggregation functions and group by clauses.
